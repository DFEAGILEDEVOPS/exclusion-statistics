# Exclusion Statistics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dfe-analytical-services/exclusion-statistics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dfe-analytical-services/exclusion-statistics)

## Summary

This project defines an [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application that visualises the published exclusion statistics.

The application is under development.

## Running the project

To run the project on your machine you need to do the following:

1. Clone the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/exclusion-statistics.git`

2. Ensure that you have [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed. This is so that packrat can install dependencies correctly.

3. Open the project by double clicking the exclusion-statistics.Rproj file.

4. Wait for packrat to install the packages (this can take a while). Until you see the following do not stop the code:

`Packrat bootstrap successfully completed. Restarting R and entering packrat mode...`
   
5. Open the UI.R or Server.R file and hit Run App.
